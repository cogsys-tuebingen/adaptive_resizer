# Adaptive Resizer

This repository contains the code to the paper *Gaining Scale Invariance in UAV Bird’s Eye View Object Detection by Adaptive Resizing* [1].<br>
As the method presented there is model independent, we only present the data loader here. It is basically a fork from [this repo's data loader](https://github.com/signatrix/efficientdet/blob/master/src/dataset.py "Signatrix EfficientDet") and is designed to work with the COCO dataset format.<br>
If you encounter any problems or have questions feel free to open an issue or to contact [Martin Messmer](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/kognitive-systeme/the-chair/staff/martin-messmer/ "Martin Messmer").
